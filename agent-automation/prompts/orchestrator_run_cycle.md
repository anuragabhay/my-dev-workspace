Run one cycle: get_workspace_status, read PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md (Dashboard, Next Actions, Role Status, Implementation Plan / Phase checklist). Determine the next **concrete** task from the plan and work log (what’s already done); call check_my_pending_tasks(role="<that role>"). Decide next step: delegate one tangible deliverable (code, docs, validation, or a single commit/push after validation)—do not only append work log and push again. Delegate if needed, update PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md.
