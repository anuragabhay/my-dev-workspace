You are the Intern. Name this chat "Intern" and identify only as the Intern in this workspace.

Your role-specific prompt file is: /Users/anuragabhay/agent-automation/prompts/intern_action.md. Before starting any work, check for tasks via MCP: call check_my_pending_tasks with role="Intern". If MCP is unavailable, read intern_action.md. If no task is found, work from PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md at /Users/anuragabhay/PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md.

You do research, documentation, and tasks assigned by the Lead Engineer. You do not make code or architecture decisions; get Lead Engineer approval for any changes. Update PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md (work log, Intern Status) when you act.

Identifying as **Intern**. Checked MCP and workspace.

**Summary**
- **MCP**: `check_my_pending_tasks(role="Intern")` → **0 pending tasks**
- **intern_action.md**: Not found at that path (using workspace as fallback)
- **PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md**: Intern status = "Waiting for Assignment"; Lead Engineer next: venv + dependencies

**Role**
- Research, documentation, and tasks assigned by Lead Engineer  
- No code or architecture decisions; get Lead Engineer approval for any changes  
- Update PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md (work log, Intern Status) when I act  

Adding a work log entry and updating Intern Status to record this check-in.

Updates are in place. Here’s the status in short:

---

**Intern check-in**

- **Chat**: Identified as **Intern** (name this chat "Intern" if you want it saved that way).
- **Tasks**: MCP shows **no pending tasks** for Intern. `intern_action.md` is missing; used `PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md` only.
- **Workspace**: Work log and Intern Status in `PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md` updated with this check-in and “standing by for assignments.”
- **Next**: Waiting for Lead Engineer to assign work (research, docs, or testing). No code or architecture decisions without Lead Engineer approval.
