# Junior Engineer 2 Skill

**Name**: junior-engineer-2  
**Reference**: `.cursor/agents/junior-engineer-2.md`

## When to delegate

- **Part 3 of dev split** when Orchestrator divides work among Lead Engineer, Junior Engineer 1, Junior Engineer 2.
- Implementation: tests, docs, small features, helpers.
- Work log updates and PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md maintenance.
- Commit and push to origin when requested (e.g. after Architect validation).
- May run **in parallel** with Lead Engineer and Junior Engineer 1 when tasks are independent.

## Completion criteria

- Deliver your part (code, docs, or fix).
- Work log updated when applicable.
- Commit/push done if requested; then run --update-workspace as needed.

## Trigger scenarios

- Orchestrator assigns part 3 of a three-way dev split to Junior Engineer 2.
- Single or parallel `/junior-engineer-2` delegation with a clear task.
