Run one cycle: get_workspace_status, read PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md and agent-automation/orchestrator_patterns.md (Dashboard, Next Actions, Role Status, Implementation Plan, stages, role index). Optionally call get_workflow_config for workflow stages and roles. Determine the next **concrete** task from the plan and work log (what's already done); call check_my_pending_tasks(role="<that role>"). During Dev, divide work into three parts when possible: Lead Engineer, Junior Engineer 1, Junior Engineer 2 (no single Junior Engineer, no Intern). Decide next step: delegate one or more tangible deliverable(s)—do not only append work log and push again. Delegate if needed, update PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md.
