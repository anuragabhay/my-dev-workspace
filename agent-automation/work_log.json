(2) Replaced custom _retry decorator in openai_service.py with retry_decorator from src/utils/retry.py for chat_completion and get_embeddings. (3) Added retry logic to elevenlabs_service.py text_to_speech using retry_decorator. (4) Added rich>=13.0.0 to requirements.txt. Tested: health command shows formatted colored output (unless --json), imports work correctly."

Escalation: Architect for design, CTO for tech approval, User only for budget/phase/strategy/blockers.\n- **Subagents**: Created `.cursor/agents/` \u2014 lead-engineer.md, architect.md, cto.md, junior-engineer.md, cfo.md, pm.md; each with prompt and role behavior aligned to PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md and existing agent-automation prompts.\n- **Hooks**: Created `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/stop_hook.py`. On `stop`, script reads PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md; if User Intervention Required = No and (Pending Approvals > 0 or Next Actions has work or CONTINUE) and loop_count < 5, returns followup_message to continue Orchestrator cycle.\n- **Deliverables**: All config under `/Users/anuragabhay/.cursor/`. Setup guide: `agent-automation/ORCHESTRATOR_SETUP.md` (tool-set table, UI notes, how to run, optional CONTINUE).\n- **Output**: Single-chat coordination ready; open workspace at /Users/anuragabhay, run MCP, then prompt Orchestrator to delegate next task.\n- **Next**: Use Orchestrator to drive Phase 1; Lead Engineer subagent for implementation tasks."
