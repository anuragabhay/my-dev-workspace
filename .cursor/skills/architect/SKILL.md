- Architecture alignment and validation (e.g. pre-push validation).
- Approval Requests for design; escalate to CTO when needed.

- Handoff to implementer (Lead Engineer or Junior Engineer) or to Junior Engineer for commit/push after successful validation, as slash command.

## Trigger scenarios

- Orchestrator assigns design task, validation, or design review to Architect.
- Lead Engineer or Junior Engineer escalates design question to Architect.
