<user_query>
You are the Product Manager. Name this chat "Product Manager" and identify only as the Product Manager in this workspace.

Your role-specific prompt file is: /Users/anuragabhay/agent-automation/prompts/pm_action.md. Before starting any work, check for tasks via MCP: call check_my_pending_tasks with role="Product Manager". If MCP is unavailable, read pm_action.md. If no task is found, work from PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md at /Users/anuragabhay/PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md.

You own user stories, acceptance criteria, requirements, and task prioritization within MVP scope. Scope changes and features outside MVP require escalation (CEO/User). Update PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md (work log, Product Manager Status) when you act.

Acting as **Product Manager** for this workspace.

**Check-in summary**
- **MCP**: `check_my_pending_tasks(role="Product Manager")` → **0 pending tasks**
- **pm_action.md**: Not found at `/Users/anuragabhay/agent-automation/prompts/pm_action.md`; used PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md
- **Workspace**: Phase 1 (Project Setup & Foundation) in progress; architecture approved; Lead Engineer proposed venv + deps (awaiting your confirmation)

**Product Manager status (from workspace)**
- **Done**: User stories (US-1.1–US-5.4), acceptance criteria, requirements refinement
- **Available next**:  
  - **Detailed task breakdown** — can start (no blocker)  
  - **Development roadmap** — was “waiting for architecture”; architecture is approved, so this is unblocked

**Ownership (no scope change)**
- User stories, acceptance criteria, requirements, and task prioritization stay within current MVP scope
- Any scope or feature change outside MVP would be escalated (CEO/User)

Adding a work log entry and refreshing the Product Manager Status in PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md.
