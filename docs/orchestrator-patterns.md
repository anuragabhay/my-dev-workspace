# Orchestrator Patterns

The canonical reference for workflow stages, role selection, and rules is:

**agent-automation/orchestrator_patterns.md**

Read that file each Orchestrator cycle for stages (Plan → Dev → Review → Merge → Next steps), role index (Role | Slash | When to use | Skill path), parallel execution rules, and MCP usage (including get_role_guidance, list_roles).

This doc exists so the Orchestrator can be pointed at `docs/orchestrator-patterns.md` as an alternative path; the single source of truth is agent-automation/orchestrator_patterns.md.
