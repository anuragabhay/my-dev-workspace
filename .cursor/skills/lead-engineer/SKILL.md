# Lead Engineer Skill

**Name**: lead-engineer  
**Reference**: `.cursor/agents/lead-engineer.md`

## When to delegate

- Core implementation and architecture-critical code in youtube-shorts-generator.
- Config, venv, main tests, and design-in-code tasks from the Implementation Plan.
- Ownership of features and services; coordination with Junior Engineer, Reviewer, Tester as needed.

## Completion criteria

- Feature/service delivered (code, config, integration).
- Relevant tests run and passing before handoff.
- Short handoff note; if next step is another role, output the slash command (e.g. `/reviewer ...` or `/junior-engineer-1 ...` or `/junior-engineer-2 ...`).

## Trigger scenarios

- Orchestrator assigns a Phase item or concrete task from Implementation Plan to Lead Engineer.
- Design or "how to implement" questions escalated from Junior Engineer; implement after Architect/CTO approval.
